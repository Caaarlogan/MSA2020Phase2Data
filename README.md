# MSA2020Phase2Data

This is my submission for Phase 2 of MSA2020 in the Data Science pathway.

My notebook for solving my business case is NBA2K Sentiment Analysis using api_funcs.py to use the reddit api to gather my data.

My notebook for training the classifier for the Kaggle challenge is Kaggle_Sentiment_Analysis using an RNN with Tensorflow and Multinomial and Gaussian Naive Bayes models.
